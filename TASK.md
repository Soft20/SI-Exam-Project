# Requirements
While solving the task, you must consider the following mandatory requirements and limitations:

## To Dora
- [ ] A monolithic or legacy object-oriented application (https://exchangeratesapi.io/)
- [ ] enterprise messaging
- [ ] event streaming
- [ ] evaluate figma diagram

## TBD
- [ ] A monolithic or legacy object-oriented application
- [ ] Python Logging & Monitoring
- [ ] Python Testing

### Subject of integration are several disparate applications, application components, and data sources:
**A monolithic or legacy object-oriented application**  
Valuta API? https://exchangeratesapi.io/

### TBD

**SOAP/REST web services or SOA implementation**  
We are using REST

**Microservices architecture application**  
Eureka Discovery Service

### The integration architecture design reflects on the business context:
**includes BPMN modelling and automation**  
Using previous assignment as reference

**follows enterprise integration patterns, EIP**  
Using previous assignment as reference

**enables sharing, integration and transformation of data between system components, data structures and file formats**  
Services uses each other

### The development implements variety of integration and communication technics:
**RESTful APIs and API management**  
Maybe using Restify

**enterprise messaging**  
### Ask Dora for Obligation

**event streaming**  
### Ask Dora for Obligation

**Microservices composition, discovery, and management**  
Eureka

### The product also illustrates use of
**variety of programming languages and development platforms**  
TypeScript, Python & Java

**decoupling, choreography and orchestration of components**  
Implicit

**synchronous and asynchronous interaction styles**  
Implicit

**logging and monitoring the system or its components**  
TypeScript - Express Monitoring, Winston Logging
Python - TBD

**producing error messages in human-readable format**  
Implicit (RESTfull)

### The product integration channels are tested for both success and failure by means of either
**a web, mobile, or console client application, which provides a simple interface for illustrating the functionality of the integrated system.**  
TypeScript - Jest
Python - TBD
